# Binary Clock

#English translation
Anyone can see it.
This is a binary clock.
Time is represented by 3*6 squares, with 6 squares in the first row being "hour", 6 squares in the second row being "minutes", and 6 squares in the third row being "seconds".
The white squares represent the time at this time, and the six white squares represent 2^ 0,2 ^1 from right to left, respectively..., 2 ^ 5
There are many ways to express time, and I believe there will be more ways to perceive time in the future.

#中文译文
任何人都可以借鉴它。
这是一个二进制时钟。
用3*6方格表示时间，第一行6个方格为“时”，第二行6个方格为“分”，第三行6个方格为“秒”
白色方格表示此时时间，6个方格为白色从右至左分别表示2^0，2^1，……，2^5
时间的表达方式多种多样，我相信未来将会有更多的感知方式获取时间
